# FollowCheck - Instagram Follower Checker

A privacy-focused web app that helps you see who is not following you back on Instagram. All processing happens in your browser. No data is uploaded or stored.

**Your feed should feel like your life, not just a list.**

FollowCheck lets you see who is not following you back using only the data you download directly from Instagram. No login. No API. No third-party apps.

> **Built for clarity, not clout.**  
> 100 percent local. Nothing leaves your device.

## How It Works

1. Request your Instagram data as a JSON export.
2. Upload the `following.json` and `followers_1.json` (and `followers_2.json`, etc. if present).
3. Instantly see who is not following you back.

Everything happens in your browser. No servers, no tracking, and no accounts needed.
